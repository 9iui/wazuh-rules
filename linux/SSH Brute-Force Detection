# SSH Brute-Force Detection

**Rule ID:** 5710  
**Category:** Authentication Failures  
**Platform:** Linux  
**MITRE ATT&CK:** T1110 – Brute Force  

---

## Purpose
Detect repeated failed SSH login attempts originating from the same source IP within a short period of time.  
This behavior is commonly associated with automated brute-force tools attempting to guess credentials.

---

## Use Case
Linux servers exposed to the internet are frequently targeted by automated SSH brute-force bots attempting login with common usernames and passwords.

This detection helps identify:
- Password spraying
- Credential brute forcing
- Automated scanning tools targeting SSH

---

## Simulated Scenario
An attacker uses a tool such as Hydra to attempt SSH logins using common usernames like:
- root  
- admin  
- ubuntu  

Within **45 seconds**, multiple failed login attempts are generated from the same IP address and recorded in authentication logs.
